# GAME-Using-python-
This is a game similar to Fruit Ninja created by halfbricks which was initially played on mobile using the touch sensor . So I build the game of same concept but different way to interact with the interface , which is in this game the camera gets on and detects the hand movement and slices the fruit . Replacing the touch sense, Give it a whirl
